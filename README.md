## Description 

This project focuses on developing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system to control the movements of a virtual car using brain waves and EEG signals. The objective is to classify EEG signals into attentive and relaxed states to control the car in a racing game.

## Supplies

### Hardware:
- 1 x BioAmp EXG Pill (with JST PH 2.0 connector and a header pin)
- 1 x BioAmp Cable v3
- 3 x Gel Electrodes
- 3 x Jumper Cables
- 1 x Arduino Uno / Maker Uno with USB Cable (You can also use any other microcontroller board with an ADC)
- 1 x Nuprep Skin Preparation Gel
- 1 x Wet wipe
- 1 x Brain BioAmp Band (optional)
- 1 x Electrode Gel (only if using Brain BioAmp Band)

### Software:
- Arduino IDE
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Collab

## Machine Learning Models Implemented

The following machine learning models were implemented in this project:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## Results

The best-performing models for this classification task are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes, as they all achieved an accuracy of 0.7723 and an F1 score of 0.8715.
